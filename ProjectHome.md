CMS from Scratch is a content management system designed for smaller sites on systems where a database may not be available.

It runs on PHP 4 or 5, and doesn't use a database, just a variety of file includes.

If you find success with the CMS, please consider making a donation at http://cmsfromscratch.com/donate.php

CMS from Scratch is made possible by the generous support of some of the designers and developers who use it commercially. If you're making money with CMSfS, please feel free to make a voluntary contribution to support our work at http://cmsfromscratch.com/donate.php
